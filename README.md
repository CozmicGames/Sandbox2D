# GameTemplate

A simple game template, making use of [Kore](https://github.com/GratedGames/Kore).
The project contains an incmplete selection of stuff I made on top of Kore, to form a loose game framework/engine.
Later iterations may feature a more elaborate approach to make a coherent engine and may contain much more of what I made on top of [Kore](https://github.com/GratedGames/Kore).

It imports [Kore](https://github.com/GratedGames/Kore) from a local maven repository, this can be changed in the build.grade.kts file.
